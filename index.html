   <i><b> In academic work, the majority of works are not free,</b> [24] Authors may see open access publishing as a method of expanding the audience that is able to access their work to allow for greater impact of the publication, or may support it for ideological reasons.</i>

 	<h3 align="center"> Legislation </h3>

 	<b>Any country has its own law and legal system,</b> sustained by its legislation, a set of law-documents â€” documents containing statutory obligation rules, usually law and created by legislatures.  The automatic protection provided by Berne Convention not apply to law-documents: Article 2.4 excludes the official texts from the automatic protection. It is also possible to "inherit" the license from context. The set of country's law-documents is made available through national repositories.
